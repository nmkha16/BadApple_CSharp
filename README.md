# BadApple_CSharp

This is pretty simple, let break it down to three steps.
1. Extract all frames from Video then convert all said frames to bitmap (can be anything jpg, png...).

2. Convert all bitmaps to ASCII.

3. Profit.

Important Notices:
```
The directory is hardcoded so include 'video/badapple.mp4' and 'audio.wav' to your project file or release folder.
```
