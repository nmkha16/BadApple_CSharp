This is pretty simple, let break it down to three steps.
1. Extract all frames from a video then convert all said frames to bitmap (can be anything jpg, png...).

2. Convert all bitmaps to ASCII.

3. Profit.

Important Notices:
```
The directory is hardcoded so include 'video/badapple.mp4' and 'audio.wav' to your project file or release folder.
```
